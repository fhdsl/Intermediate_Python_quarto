## Welcome!

## Introductions

-   Who am I?

. . .

-   What is DaSL?

. . .

-   Who are you?

    -   Name, pronouns, group you work in

    -   What you want to get out of the class

    -   Favorite winter activity

## Goals of the course

. . .

-   Continue building *programming fundamentals*: How to use complex data structures, create custom functions, and how to iterate repeated tasks.

. . .

-   Continue exploration of *data science fundamentals*: how to clean messy data using the programming fundamentals above to a Tidy form for analysis.

## Content of the course

1.  Fundamentals and Dictionaries
2.  Iteration
3.  Functions
4.  Iteration styles
5.  Assignment and References
6.  Modules, Wrap-up

## Format of the course

. . .

-   Hybrid, and recordings will be available.

. . .

-   1-2 hour exercises after each session are encouraged for practice; time at beginning of class provided to work on exercises.

. . .

-   Office Hours Fridays 10am - 11am PT.

## Culture of the course

. . .

-   Challenge: We are learning a new language, but you already have a full-time job

. . .

-   *Teach not for mastery, but teach for empowerment to learn effectively.*

## Culture of the course

-   Challenge: We sometimes struggle with our data science in isolation, unaware that someone two doors down from us has gone through the same struggle.

. . .

-   *We learn and work better with our peers.*

. . .

-   *Know that if you have a question, other people will have it.*

. . .

We ask you to follow [Participation Guidelines](https://hutchdatascience.org/communitystudios/guidelines/) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fhdsl/coc).

## Data types

| Data type name | **Data type shorthand** |      **Examples**       |
|----------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Integer        |           int           |          2, 4           |
| Float          |          float          |      3.5, -34.1009      |
| String         |           str           | "hello", "234-234-8594" |
| Boolean        |          bool           |       True, False       |

## Data structures

-   List

-   Dataframe

    -   Series

-   **Dictionary**

-   **Tuple\
    **

## Objects in Python

Formally, an object contains the following:

*What does it contain?*

-   **Value** that holds the essential data for the object.

-   **Attributes** that hold subset of the data or additional data for the object.

. . .

*What can it do?*

-   Functions called **Methods** specific to the data type and automatically takes the object as input.

. . .

This organizing structure on an object applies to pretty much all Python data types and data structures.

## Lists as an Object

*What does it contain?*

-   **Value**: the contents of the list, such as `[2, 3, 4]`.

. . .

-   **Attributes**: subsetting via `[ ]`.

. . .

*What can it do (methods)?*

-   `my_list.append(4)` appends 4 to the last element of `my_list`, but does not return anything.

## Dataframe as an Object

*What does it contain?*

-   **Value**: the spreadsheet of data.

. . .

-   **Attributes**:

    -   Columns of the data

    -   `.columns`

    -   `.shape`

    -   `.iloc[ , ]` , `.loc[ , ]` for subsetting

. . .

*What can it do (methods)?*

-   `.head()`

-   `.tail()`

## Dictionary

A **dictionary** is designed as a lookup table, organized in **key-value** pairs. You associate the key with a particular value, and use the key to find the value.

. . .

```{python}
sentiment = {'happy': 8, 'sad': 2, 'joy': 7.5, 'embarrassed': 3.6, 'restless': 4.1, 'apathetic': 3.8, 'calm': 7}
sentiment
```

. . .

You use a key to find its corresponding value:

```{python}
sentiment['joy']
```

## Rules of Dictionaries

-   Only one value per key. No duplicate keys allowed.

. . .

-   **Keys** must be of string, integer, float, boolean, or tuple.

. . .

-   **Values** can be of any type, including data structures such as lists and dictionaries.

. . .

```{python}
duplicated_keys = {'Student' : 97, 'Student': 88, 'Student' : 91}
duplicated_keys
```

## Misuse 

You cannot use a numerical index to find values, like you did for Lists!

```{python}
#sentiment[0]
```

. . .

If a key doesn't exist, you will get an error:

```{python}
#sentiment["rain"]
```
